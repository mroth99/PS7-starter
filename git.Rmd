1. 
- Phillip is responsible for:
  - pem_cr

- Julia is responsible :
  - summary.pem_cr
  - print.pem_cr
  
2.
  I'd say Phillip contributed more to the code. He added and deleted a lot of code, whereat Julia "only" contributed 
  one  huge chunk of code.
  
3.
  Phillip pushed far more often than Julia. He pushed 6 times, she pushed only once. 
  
4.
  Yes they do have different styles. Phillip tends to pushing more frequently. Julia only pushes when she's sure the      code is correct.
