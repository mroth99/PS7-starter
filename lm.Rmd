# Model Math

A linear model can be characterised by the following structural normal equation:

\begin{equation} 
  X^TXy = X^Ty \beta
\end{equation} 

where $X is the data or design matrix, $y$ the dependent variable and $beta$ the coefficient vector.

# Fitting in R

A model can be fit with the following code (using the `iris` data):

```{r}
linear_model <- lm(Petal.Width ~. , data = iris)
```

A summary can be obtained via:

```{r}
summary( linear_model)
```
